<a name="about-the-project"></a>
## ‚ö°Ô∏èAbout The Project
This is the guide to setup Jenkins Server with docker compose. <br>
Jenkins help to automate the software for building, testing, deploying, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). <br>
There are many ways to install Jenkins Server like installer, install with docker, install with brew (MacOs).<br>
Below guild is to install Jenkins Server with Docker.


<a name="built-with"></a>
### ü™ì Built With
This project is built with
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)


<a name="getting-started"></a>
## üî• Getting Started
See the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) sections for basic knowledge and go as per below [Instruction](#instruction) section.


<a name="before-you-begin"></a>
### üîî Before you begin
If you are new in Git, GitHub and new in Spring Boot configuration structure, <br>
You should see basic detail instructions first in here [Spring Boot Application Instruction](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-boot-app-instruction)<br>
If you are not good enough in basic Docker Compose commands, you can learn some commands in below projects. <br>
Click below links.
* [Spring Boot Docker Compose Sample](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-boot-docker-compose-sample)


<a name="clone-project"></a>
### ü•° Clone Project
* Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yewin-mm/jenkins-server.git
   ```
<a name="prerequisites"></a>
### üîë Prerequisites
Prerequisites can be found here, [Spring Boot Application Instruction](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-boot-app-instruction). <br>
You need to install `Docker` in your machine. [Get Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). <br>
You can learn sample docker-compose commands here. [Spring Boot Docker Compose Sample](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-boot-docker-compose-sample)


<a name="instruction"></a>
### üìù Instruction
* Make sure docker is running in your machine.
* Go to your cloned folder (clone this repo) with `cmd` (for window)  or `terminal` (for Mac and Linux).

<a name="run"></a>
#### Run Jenkins Server
* Below commands need to type in your `CMD` or `Terminal` where path should be in your application folder.
* Run Jenkins Server (with port 9000)
  * ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
  * After that you can call jenkins server portal with `http://localhost:9000/` through browser. (if you run jenkins at vm server, you need to add `server ip` or `domain` instead of `localhost`).

<a name="unlock"></a>
#### Unlock Jenkins
* After you get in jenkins server portal through browser by `http://localhost:9000/`,
* You will see below unlock screen to unlock jenkins server.
<h3 align="center">
  Unlock Jenkins

</h3>

* Type below command in `CMD` or `Terminal`.
  * ```sh
    docker exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
    ```
* Then you will get initial password like below
<h3 align="center">
Sample initial password

</h3>

* Copy initial password which appeared in your `CMD` or `Terminal` by typing above command.
* Paste in jenkins server portal to unlock jenkins server.
* Please note that initial password is no need to use in the future. It's need only one time (this time). 


<a name="install-plugins"></a>
#### Install Suggested Plugins
* After you've unlocked jenkins server portal,
* Choose Install Suggested Plugins as below picture.
* This step will take a few minutes.
<h3 align="center">
Install Suggested Plugins

</h3>

* Just click `Save and Finish` button to go with `localhost:9000` which port I put in `docker compose`.
* Click `Start using Jenkins`.
* After that you can see the `jenkins server portal` like below.
